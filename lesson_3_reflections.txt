When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be useful when either I might need to work on this set of files from more 
than one computer, or if I was working with other developers so that we could share files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This lets you control how often you get remote changes. If you are in the middle of 
working on a feature, it could be distracting to suddenly see different behavior in 
your code (due to an auto pull) and wonder whether you caused the change. If you 
manually pull down code changes, then you are more aware of when to expect changes 
like this.

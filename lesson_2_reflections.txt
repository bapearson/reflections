What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git directory is created locally and a new repository is 
initialized through Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you collect one or more files from your working directory 
that you want to commit to your repository.
It lets you create a collection of files to commit together as one commit action, 
and it also gives you a chance to review the collection of files before actually 
doing the commit. This way, you have a chance to remove files or add before the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can run diff commands to compare what you have changed compared to the last commit. 
You can see all files that are modified as well as what was changed in each file. 
Not all modified files in the working directory have to be in the staging area.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git directory is created locally and a new repository is 
initialized through Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you collect one or more files from your working directory 
that you want to commit to your repository.
It lets you create a collection of files to commit together as one commit action, 
and it also gives you a chance to review the collection of files before actually 
doing the commit. This way, you have a chance to remove files or add before the commit.
